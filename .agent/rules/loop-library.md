# Loop Library — loop-library skill

When the task involves **repeatable agent workflows**, **iterative improvement with verification**, **recurring automation**, or the user asks to **find**, **adapt**, or **design** a loop, follow this rule and read **`.agents/skills/loop-library/SKILL.md`** before acting.

**Skill paths by tool:** `.agents/skills/loop-library/`, `.agents/skills/loop-library/`, `.agents/skills/loop-library/`, `.agents/skills/loop-library/`

See **`.agents/references/loop-library.md`** for CLI cheat sheet and maintainer refresh.

## Tiered workflow

| Task type | Required action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Find** — user wants an existing published loop | `npx loop-library@latest recommend "<goal>" --json` → read SKILL → rank top 3 with links |
| **Adapt** — user names a loop slug | `npx loop-library show <slug> --json` or `adapt <slug> --json` → apply SKILL grounding rules |
| **Design** — no good match | SKILL interview only (one question at a time) |
| **One-shot** — single action, no feedback cycle | Do **not** invoke loop-library; use normal workflow commands |

## Smart pairing

1. **CLI first** when shell is available — deterministic shortlist, minimal context cost.
2. **Skill second** — rank by outcome fit, verification, authority, and stopping conditions.
3. **One-shot escape hatch** — if no feedback cycle is needed, recommend a single workflow instead of manufacturing a loop.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not invent Loop Library titles, slugs, contributor names, or URLs.
- Do not enable schedules, production changes, or external messages without explicit user approval.
- Do not load the full catalog into context when the CLI shortlist suffices.
- Do not treat designing a loop as authorization to run it autonomously.
